We split the dataset Cats vs. Dogs randomly into 20000 training images and 5000 test images, and the random split used in our paper is given in this folder. 

The dog test image indices and cat test image indices are respectively given in dog_idx.txt and cat_idx.txt, and other image indices in the original dataset correspond to our training data.
